Right now (2016-02-04) the templates are just python templates.
For the project, since I'm using Flask, they should be Jinja2
templates, since Jinja2 is already includee in Flask by default.

How do Jinja2 and Mustache compare?  Mustache is advertised as
logic-less, whereas Jinja2 has {% for ... %} or whatever.  This 
seems essentially the same as the Mustache {# ... } {/ ...}
which can apply the same template code to all the elements of
a list.  It would seem to be rather simple to switch from one 
to the either.
