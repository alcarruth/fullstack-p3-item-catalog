    <h2> Lesson 3 - Developing with Frameworks </h2>

    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 1 - Introducing Frameworks and Flask </h3>

    <p>
        So up to this point, we've created our code almost purely from
        scratch, using a few internal libraries like HTTP_Base_Server and
        external libraries like SQL_Alchemy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Creating a website from scratch really shows that you have a good
        grasp of underlying programming concepts and are able to utilize the
        power of Python, but as we make our website more and more complex,
        the code becomes repetitive and difficult to maintain.
    </p>

    <p>
        Frameworks are collections of code that simplify the web development
        process.  They take care of repetitive tasks and allow us to focus
        on the more unique features of our project.  At the moment, some of
        the most popular frameworks out there are 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails">
            Ruby on Rails,</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">
            .Net </a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)">
            Django, </a>  but if we take a look at this 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_frameworks">
            Wikipedia article, </a> we see that there are hundreds of
        frameworks developers have created to code web applications
        more efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
        Frameworks may rise and fall in popularity but the same underlying
        concepts for developing web pages applies for all of these
        technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Think of a framework as a box of prepared cake mix.  We could make a
        cake using all of these items from scratch and would probably have a
        better understanding of how to make cakes.
    </p>

    <p>
        But if we have several cakes to make in a short period of time,
        finding a good cake mix simplifies the preparation process and helps
        us focus on other things, like frosting.
    </p>

    <p>
        In lesson two you built a website with the raw ingredients of web
        development.  Now it's time to see how we can use frameworks to
        improve our development process.
    </p>

    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

    <h3> Section 2 - Lesson 3 Overview </h3>

    <p>
        In this lesson, you'll create a menu app, using the Flask
        framework.  I will start by showing you the basic components
        of a Flask application, with a simple hello world program,
        which you will then create on your own.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then we will connect to our database via SQL Alchemy to view
        all of the items in each restaurant menu.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, you will learn about templates, and how they allow you
        to write HTML code, separately from Python code, keeping your
        application more organized.
    </p>

    <p>
        After that, I will introduce a special function in Flask
        called
        <code> url_for()</code>, which builds the URLs that you will use to navigate
        through your new Flask application.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will then create forms to capture data from users, and use
        message flashing to notify the user each time they
        successfully change information in the database.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will discuss a way to use flash to add the option to send
        JSON messages instead of HTML, and finally, take some time to
        style our app with some CSS.
    </p>

    <h3> Section 3 - Running Your First Flask Application </h3>

    <p>
        Let's go ahead and create our first application in Flask.  Create a
        file name <code> project.py</code> in the same directory as the database 
        <code> setup.py </code>
        file.
    </p>
    
<pre class="inset">
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/hello')
def HelloWorld():
   return "Hello World"

if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.debug = True
   app.run(host = '0.0.0.0', port = 5000)
</pre>

    <p>
        A minimal flask application looks something like this.  Let's take a
        look at this code together and see what's going on.  First, I
        imported this Flask class from the flask library.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, I create an instance of this class with the name of the
        running application as the argument.  Any time we run an
        application in Python, a special variable
        called <code>__name__</code> gets defined for the application
        and all of the imports it uses.  The application run by the
        Python interpreter gets a name variable set
        to <code>__main__</code>, whereas all the other important
        Python files get a
        <code>__name__</code> variable fit to the actual name of the Python file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, I have this thing that looks like a function, but starts
        with an at symbol.  This is called a decorator in Python.
        This decorator essentially wraps our function inside the
        app.route function, that flask is already created, so if
        either of these routes get sent from the browser, the function
        that we define here gets executed.
    </p>

    <p>
        If this is difficult to follow, it's okay.  I'll provide a link in
        the Instructor Notes if you're interested in learning more about
        decorator functions.  Just know that this @app.route piece of code,
        will call the function that follows it, whenever the website
        receives your request with a URL that matches its argument.  So in
        this case, if we visit the root of the site, or the back slash hello
        page, this hello world function will be invoked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inside my hello world function, I return the message I want to
        display to the user's browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jumping to the last line of our code, I use the run function
        to run the local server with our application.  The if
        statement here makes sure the server only runs if the script
        is executed directly from the python interpreter, and not used
        as an imported module.  So basically, this line of code says,
        if you're executing me with a Python interpreter, then do
        this, but, if you're importing me into another Python file,
        don't do this.
    </p>

    <p>
        But you still have access to the rest of the code.  By
        default, the server is only accessible from the host machine
        and not from any other computer.  This is a default, because
        in debugging mode, a user of the application can execute
        arbitrary Python code on your computer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since we are using a vagrant environment for this course we
        must make our server publicly available by changing the call
        of the run method to look like this.  This tells the web
        server on my vagrant machine to listen on all public IP
        addresses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Restarting our server each time we make a modification to our
        code can get pretty annoying, but Flask can take care of this
        for us.  If you enable debug support, the server will reload
        itself each time it notices a code change.  It will also
        provide you a helpful debugger in the browser if things go
        wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'll save this code as <code> project.py</code>, in the same directory as my
        <code>restaurant.db</code> file, and execute it with the python
        interpreter.
    </p>

    <p>
        Visiting <code>localhost:5000</code>
        or <code>localhost:5000/hello</code>, I see the output of my
        code.
    </p>

    <p>
        To stop the server, I hit <code>Ctrl+C.</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        So we see that with much fewer lines of code, I executed a
        similar version of our hello world from lesson two.  Notice
        that with Flask, we don't have to write out response codes
        anymore.  You will soon see that this is just one of the
        several features frameworks take care of automatically for the
        developer.

    <h3> Section 4 - First Flask App Quiz </h3>

    <p>
        Take a look again at these routing functions.  Notice that I have
        two of them here.  What happens if I were to get rid of this
        <code>@app.route("/")</code> ?  Test this out on your machine and see if you
        notice any differences.
    </p>



    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 5 - First Flask App Quiz </h3>

    <p>
        The <code>@app.route('\')</code> line takes you to the same
        page as visiting the <code>@app.route('/hello')</code>.  If this is not
        present, then we get a File Not Found error on our browser, if
        we just visit localhost port 5000, making it seem as if a
        website didn't live at this address.
    </p>

    <p>
        Decorators in Python can be stacked one on top of the other, so the
        <code>@app.route('/')</code> will call
        the <code>app.route('/hello')</code>, which will call
        the <code> HelloWorld</code> function.  This is useful for
        having different URLs all route to the same place.  Try
        visiting amazon.com and amazon.com/index to see how their
        server also handles routing different URLs to the same home
        page
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

    <h3> Section 6 - Adding Database to Flask Application </h3>

    <p>
        So now that we have a functioning Flask application, let's bring our
        CRUD functionality into it.  I will import the code for SQLAlchemy
        and the database engine in sessionmaker like in Lessons 1 and 2.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now I'm going to change my <code>HelloWorld()</code> function such that it performs
        this following query to grab the first restaurant out of my
        database, and list out all of the menu items and stored in a string
        called <code>output</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'll also add a break line tag to make my output a bit easier to
        read.  I will return this output string so that my user sees it from
        the browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I save my Python file my flask server instantly refreshes
        itself, so when I refresh the page I now see all of my menu items
        listed.
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

    <h3> Section 7 - Adding Database to Flask Application Quiz </h3>

    <p>
        Try this thing out the menu items with Flask on your own
        machine and modify the code to list out the price and
        description for each menu item.  You may want to add a few
        line breaks to make your output easy to read from within your
        browser
    </p>

    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 8 - Adding Database to Flask Application Solution </h3>


    <p>
        In order to solve this problem, all I had to do was add 
        <code> i.price</code> a
        <code> &lt;br&gt;</code> and <code>i.description</code>,
        followed by two more <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>s to my output
        stream.  The solution code for this is available within the
        instructor notes.

    <h3> Section 9 - Routing </h3>

    <p>
        Most modern web applications have elegant URLs.  This helps people
        remember links, which then can be easily bookmarked or shared with
        others.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we saw in previous videos, the route decorator is used to bind
        the function to a URL, but there is more to it, than just static
        paths.  We can make certain paths of the URL dynamic, and attach
        multiple rows to a function.
    </p>

    <p>
        To add variables to a URL, I can specify a rule, with type: variable
        name, where type can be an integer, string, or another path.  I will
        restructure the code for my menu app as so, and use the restaurant
        id, to specify which menu I want to see.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that it's handy here to leave this trailing backslash, and Flask
        when render the page, even when it's not there in the URL.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will save my changes, and now when I visit
        localhost:5000/restaurants/1, I can see my first restaurant menu
        there.
    </p>

    <p>
        If I change the integer after restaurants, I can see my other
        restaurant menus in the database, as well.
    </p>

    <div class="inset">
        <h4> Instructor Notes </h4>
        
        <p>
            Since the <code> HelloWorld(restaurant_id) </code> didn't make
            much sense, I changed it to <code>
                restaurantMenu(restaurant_id)</code> in the solution code.
        </p>

    <h3> Section 10 - Routing Create Quiz </h3>

    <p>
        Download the stutter template for this code in the instructor notes.
        Note that there are functions for newMenuItem, editMenuItem, and
        deleteMenuItem, all with the parameters that they take in.  Write up
        the appropriate route decorations to properly execute these
        functions.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you can open the URLs to create, edit, and delete menu items,
        you have successfully completed this challenge.  Don't hesitate to
        view the Flask documentation or ask for help from your fellow
        students if you have any questions.
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 11 - Routing Create Quiz </h3>


    <p>
        Let's construct the route for our new menu item.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now when I visit /restaurant and pass in an integer, and then /new,
        this integer will get passed in as the new restaurant id for the
        newMenuItem function and successfully return that task one is
        complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        The editMenuItem takes in two parameters, so we need to make sure
        our route also has two parameters, the restaurant id and the menu id
        and then /edit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, we'll see that this page also works.
    </p>

    <p>
        Similarly to the edit route, the delete route looks just about the
        same except it has /delete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now our final route is also working.
        The solutions for this challenge are available in the instructor
        notes.

    <h3> Section 12 - Templates </h3>

    <p>
        Generating HTML from within Python isn't all that fun.  I am sure
        you're getting pretty tired of having to create these strings we've
        called output over and over and over.  This can get pretty
        cumbersome as our application gets more and more complex.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of that, Flask configures a template engine for you to store
        your HTML code.  To render a template you can use this cleverly
        named method called render template.
    </p>

    <p>
        All you have to do is provide the name of the template and the
        variables you want to pass to the template engine as keyword
        arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here I will render a template for my menu items page.  Flask will
        look for my templates in a folder named templates, so I'll make a
        directory called templates in the same folder as my Flask
        application, and from within it I'll create an HTML document and
        call it menu.html.
    </p>

    <p>
        But what about when we need to get information from our database or
        Python code into our HTML?  This retrieval of data is called HTML
        escaping.  Templates in Flask are already pre-configured to handle
        escape code, that is, the code that we are retrieving from our
        application and database, and putting it into our html.
    </p>

    <p>
        With HTML escaping we have access to python variables and functions,
        and can even get the results added directly into our HTML code.
    </p>


    <div class="inset">
        <h4> Instructor Notes </h4>

        <p>
            Note: <br>
            HTML Character Escaping is a way of writing special characters
            inside of HTML code, this is a different concept from the HTML
            escaping with python code shown in this lesson.

    <h3> Section 13 - Templates Quiz </h3>

    <p>
        I've created a simple template here, and called it menu.html.  A
        copy of it is available in the instructor notes.  Take a look at it,
        and see if you can figure out, how Flask accommodates for escape
        code?
    </p>

    <p>
        You should see a few symbols here, that don't look like HTML.  Try
        and see if you can figure out, what each one of them does.

    <h3> Section 14 - Templates Solution </h3>

    <p>
        All right, so we see that the code with the single bracket and a
        percent sign on either side is the logical code that we want to
        execute in our HTML, like a for loop.
    </p>

    <p>
        The double brackets indicate the code that we want it's results
        printed into the html document itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since, from within HTML codes, we cannot use indentations to mark
        the beginning and ending of statements and loops, we must use
        keywords, like endfor, and endif, to indicate the end of a loop, or
        statement.
    </p>

    <p>
        Going back to my menu.html, I can see how I'm obtaining the result of
        a query and executing the output here in my HTML page.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will also need to substitute the code I had in my restaurant menu
        method, so that instead of returning a string, we will return a
        rendered template with the new menu.html file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since I'm querying on my restaurant and menu items table, I will
        path my queries into the template, so that my escape code has access
        to these variables.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will also need to import the render template function from my Flask
        library.
    </p>

    <p>
        By saving and refreshing the page, I see the same code with a few
        stylistic modifications I added inside of my template.
    </p>

    <p>
        You'll be building your own templates very soon.  I just want to
        talk about two more topics to help you get the most out of them
        first.

    <h3> Section 15 - <code> url_for </code> Quiz </h3>


    <p>
        URL building is a helpful feature in Flask to create URLs based on
        the functions they execute.  This is really helpful when you want to
        create links to other pages inside your application.
    </p>

    <p>
        To build a URL to a specific function, we can use this url_for()
        method.  This is one of the many helper functions that Flask makes
        available to us.  The documentation for url_for() can be found on
        the Flask documentation page here.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want you to open up the menu.html template and add some new
        hyperlinks to edit and delete each menu item.  Remember that this
        url_for helper method returns a complete URL stream, so place it
        where it belongs inside of an anchor tag.  If your code works you
        should have edit and delete links now on every menu item.
    </p>

    <p>
        Read through the documentation for reference.  Consult your fellow
        students if you have any questions.
    </p>


    <div class="inset">
        <h4> Instructor Notes </h4>

        <p>
            Download the <code> menu.html</code>
            file. Add <code>url_for()</code> links to edit and delete
            each menu item.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/lobrown/Full-Stack-Foundations/blob/master/Lesson-3/07_Menu-Template-Quiz/menu.html">
                Menu-Template-Quiz </a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Flask Documentation for url_for can be found 
            <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/#url-building">
                here.</a>
        </p>
    </div>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 16 - <code> url_for </code> Solution </h3>

    <p>
        <code> url_for</code> accepts the name of the function as the first argument, and
        a number of keyword arguments each corresponding to the variable
        part of the URL rule.
    </p>

    <p>
        So if my URL needs a variable for a restaurant ID and a menu item
        ID, my url_for statement needs to look something like this, taking
        in three arguments for the function it will call and the variables
        to pass into that function.
    </p>

    <p>
        So back in my template I can add this code inside my anchor tags right
        after the href equals.
        Since this is a method in Python and I want the output printed on to
        my HTML document, I will enclose it with a double brackets.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I save my code now, I see that there are edit and delete links
        for each menu item below.
    </p>

    <p>
        So you may be wondering why you would ever want to build URLs
        instead of hard coding them into your templates.
        Well, now if you ever need to change a URL path, with URL building,
        you can change your URLs all in one place without having to remember
        to change URLs all over the place from within your application.
    </p>

    <h3> Section 17 - Form Requests and Redirects </h3>

    <p>
        We know that with HTTP, there are various types of requests that we
        can send along with URL.  By default a route in Flask only answers
        to GET requests, but that can be changed by providing the methods
        argument inside the route decorator.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will change my route to create a new menu item, such as a response
        to GET and POST requests like so.  Now that I can respond to POST
        requests, I can make forms for creating and updating menu items.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will make a new template called newMenuItem.html like so.  Take a
        second to look over the code.  Here, I'm making a small form with
        only one entry to create a new menu item name.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to get data from a form, I will input requests from my
        Flask package like so, inside my project.py file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inside my new menu item function, I will create an if statement that
        looks for a POST request.
    </p>

    <p>
        I can create a new menu item like so.  And extract the name field
        from my form using the request.form.
    </p>

    <p>
        After I create the menu item, I can then add it to my session and
        commit the session to the database.
    </p>

    <p>
        To redirect the user back to the main user page I can use a helper
        function called redirect like so.
    </p>

    <p>
        I should remember to import redirect and url_for, in order to enable
        this functionality in my project.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, I need to properly handle the get request, for creating a new
        menu item.
    </p>

    <p>
        If my server didn't receive a POST request, it's going to go ahead
        and render the template, for the new HTML template that I created,
        to create a new menu item, passing in the restaurant id as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now when I click create new item it takes me to the New Menu Item
        page and I have successfully created a new menu item
    </p>

    <h3> Section 18 Edit Menu Form </h3>

    <p>
        Now, it's your turn to make a form and Flask.  Create a template
        called, editMenuItem.html that allows me to edit the name, of a
        specific menu item.
    </p>

    <p>
        A major difference between this form, and the new menu form is that
        now you should find the menu item, you want to edit, and pass that
        in with the render template function.
    </p>

    <p>
        Use the placeholder tag in HTML, so that the user sees the information
        that they're about to modify.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, add a link called, Cancel that will take me back to the main
        menu page, if I decide I don't want to modify a menu item.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the instructor notes, you'll find a project.py file that already
        has the editMenuItem function filled out, so you just need to create
        the form that will communicate with it.
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 19 Edit Menu Form Solution </h3>

    <p>
        Inside my editMenuItem function, I see that in my render template,
        I'm passing in three variables that my editmenuitem.html file is
        going to have access to: the restaurant id, the menu id, and i,
        which is going to represent the item we want to edit.
    </p>

    <p>
        So to edit a new menu item, I'm going to create a form, just like I
        did when I created a new menu item.  Inside the form I'm going to
        call my edit menu item function with the appropriate parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here I'll prompt for the name of the new menu item and create an input
        field.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the placeholder attribute of HTML I can have that field already
        filled out with the name of the item I'm going to edit.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'll then add a button called Edit.
    </p>

    <p>
        And here I create another link to cancel just in case I realize I
        actually don't want to edit my menu item.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I save and run, I see that I can now change the name of my menu
        items.  The solution code for this video is available in the
        instructor notes.

        code.
    </p>

    <p>
        deletemenuitem.html is available in the instructor notes.

    <p>
        Your challenge is to refactor the code and project.py such that we

    <h3> Section 21 - Delete Menu Item Solution </h3>

    <p>
        The first thing I'll modify in my project.py file is this app.route,
        such that we can respond to GET and POST requests.
    </p>

    <p>
        Similarly to when I edited a menu item the next thing I'll do is find
        the item I want to delete.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my if statement I'll check again to see if it's a POST request,
        delete the item, and redirect back to my main menu.  And if it's a
        GET request, I'll go ahead and render that deleteMenuItem.html file
        with the item I want to delete.

    <h3> Section 22 Message Flashing </h3>

    <p>
        Good applications and user interfaces incorporate feedback
        throughout the user experience.  If the user does not get enough
        feedback they'll probably, end up hating the application.  We should
        add a feature that explicitly notifies the user that the system has
        responded to their input.
    </p>

    <p>
        Flask provides a really simple way to give feedback to a user.
        Message Flashing is a feature that will prompt a message to the user
        immediately, after a certain action has taken place, and then
        disappear the next time the page is requested.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can use our templates to reveal a flash message, wherever and
        however we want, from within the application.
    </p>

    <p>
        To get started, let's import flash from our Flask module.  Flashing
        works in Flask by using a concept called sessions.  This course does
        not go too in depth with sessions, but just know that sessions are a
        way a server can store information across multiple Web pages to
        create a more personalized user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the bottom of our project.py file, let's first add a secret key,
        which flask will use to create sessions for our users.  Normally,
        this should be a very secure password, if our application was live
        on the Internet but for development purposes, let's just set our key
        to super secret key.
    </p>

    <p>
        To flash the message within our application, we simply use the flash
        function like this.
    </p>

    <p>
        To get a hold of all of the flash messages, we can use get flash
        messages, which will also work from within our templates.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, from within my new menu item method, I will create a flash
        message, right after I call, session.commit.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will add the message, (new menu item created!) now, in my
        newmenuitem.html template, I will add the following code.  If you
        are not familiar, with this with construct in Python, don't worry.
        It's just a block that does some automatic clean-up, when the block
        is exited, that we don't really have to concern ourselves with.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are curious about the with method in Python, I will provide
        some resources in the instructor notes.  The get flashed messages,
        is returning an array of messages, that's going to get stored in
        this variable, called messages.
    </p>

    <p>
        We then loop through the array of message, if it's not empty, and
        print it out to our HTML document inside an Unordered List.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, when I save my code, and try making a new item, and flashed
        with a new confirmation message on my main menu screen.

    <h3> Section 24 - Message Flashing Solution </h3>

    <p>
        Right after I call session.commit( ), I'll go ahead and add a flash
        message to let my user know that a item has successfully been
        edited.
    </p>

    <p>
        Likewise, in my deleteMenuItem function I'll add another flash
        message to let the user know that a item has been deleted.
        Solutions for this challenge are available in the instructor notes.

    <h3> Section 25 - Styling </h3>

    <p>
        So we have a working application now, but we should probably add
        some style to it, if we want it to be appealing to users.  Flask can
        automatically look for CSS, JavaScript, and media files, if we put
        them in a folder named static.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I will create a folder called static, in the same directory as my
        project.py file, as so.  I will create a CSS file, and name it
        styles.css, and store it inside of this directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        By adding this following link to my template files, I will tell
        Flask to use this styles.css file when it renders this template.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I refresh my browser, I turn my old unstyled menu page into one
        that looks like this.  Take some time to add some styles to your
        menu app.  My CSS file and templates can be found in the instructor
        notes for reference.

    <h3> Section 26 - Responding With JSON </h3>

    <p>
        Responding with web pages is great, but sometimes all that needs to
        be communicated is information.  For example, let's say that there's
        a web application out there called Yum that wants to collect our
        restaurant menus and advertise them to mobile clients based on their
        location.  Free advertising, all right!
    </p>

    <p>
        This app wants to see the restaurants and menus available in our
        database but doesn't really need to parse through HTML or waste
        bandwidth receiving CSS files.  It just wants the data.  For this
        reason, developers have created APIs, or Application Programming
        Interfaces, that allow external applications to use public
        information our apps want to share, without all the bells and
        whistles.
    </p>

    <p>
        When an API is communicated over the Internet, following the rules
        of HTTP, we call this a restful API.  One of the most popular ways
        of sending data with a restful architecture is with a format called
        JSON, which stands for JavaScript object notation.  JSON uses
        attribute value pairings which are delimited by a colon.  Brackets
        are used to encapsulate individual objects.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's start coding to add this JSON feature to our application.
        Before we write the JSON function in our Flask menu app, let's first
        open up the database setup.pi and add a decorator method.  This
        serializable function will help define what data we want to send
        across, and put it in a format that Flask can easily use.
    </p>

    <p>
        Flask has a built-in package, called jsonify, that will allow us to
        easily configure an API endpoint for our application.  I will go
        ahead and import this package now in my project.py file.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this lesson we are only going to focus on using a GET request to
        get a collection of restaurant menu items, but know that other types
        of requests can be implemented as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will now create a route similar to my restaurant menu page with
        /JSON at the end.  I then create a function and name it restaurant
        menu JSON and then perform the same query as in my restaurant menu
        class, but instead of returning a template, I will return this
        jsonify class and use this loop to serialize all of my database
        entries.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, if I save and go to local host port
        5000/restaurants/1/menu/json, I return with the pure data form of my
        menu in a format that can easily be read by humans and easily parsed
        by other computers.

    <h3> Section 27 JSON Quiz </h3>

    <p>
        In this challenge, I want you to add another JSON method that will
        get a specific menu item like this, when we visit a route that looks
        like this.
    </p>

    <p>
        Template code and the example from the previous JSON request are
        available in the instructor notes.

    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 28 - JSON Solution </h3>


    <p>
        So, in order to add our second JSON endpoint, we should add a route,
        just like specified in the question.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then we create a new function.  I decided to call it menuItemJSON,
        that passes in the restaurant id and menu id, since both of them are
        specified in the URL.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'll then perform a query to get the one menu ID that I want to get
        the information about.  I will JSONify that menu item, but
        serializing it first.  You can see a copy of this code in the
        instructor notes.

    <h3> Section 29 - Lesson 3 Wrap-Up </h3>

    <p>
        Awesome job reaching the end of lesson three.  Getting over the
        learning curve takes some time, but the benefits of using a
        framework reveals themselves rather quickly.  At this point you have
        learned all the essential tools for creating a web application, and
        are ready to take on the final project.
