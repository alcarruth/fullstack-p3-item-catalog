    <h3> Section 1 - Lesson 4 Introduction </h3>

    <p>  
        Now that you have practiced using so many new tools and concepts,
        it's time to embark on your final project.  You will create a menu
        app with Flask that lists out all the restaurants in your database
        and allows you to view the menu for each of those restaurants.
    </p>

    <p>  
        Users should also be able to create, read, update and delete
        restaurants and their menu items.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be the technical lead on this project and I will not be
        telling you line by line how to write your code.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Note that the code presented in these next challenges will help you
        make a basic final project, but I strongly encourage you to go above
        and beyond by making a unique creation that you can call your own
        and share with others.
    </p>

    <h3> Section 2 - Iterative Development </h3>

    <p>  
        But before we get started, how do we go about building our web
        application?
    </p>

    <p>
        For many people, the most natural way of going about a project is to
        just dive into it head first, writing as much code as possible
        before falling asleep.  While this method feels fast, many times we
        end up spending more time fixing bugs and examining code than
        actually developing our application.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Another option is to code in pieces, working on one page here,
        another feature there, and putting everything together at the end.
        While this approach is a little more organized, we may stumble
        across several bugs when it's time to integrate all of our code
        together.  Also, we won't have a working prototype until we're
        finished with the entire project.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">
        But what if we took another approach, starting out really simple and
        layering on complexity as we go?  Not adding a new feature until we
        finish the one before.  With each feature, we stop, test, debug, and
        share to make sure we always have a working application even if it's
        very basic in the initial stages.
        </span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This way, anyone involved in the creation of our product, such as
        clients, managers, and team members, always know what the project
        status is, and what enhancements are soon to follow.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">
            This process is called 
            <em> iterative development. </em> </span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Iterative development allows developers to code in an 
        <em> agile way. </em> 
        <span class="highlight">
        What agile means is that since there is always a working prototype,
        if a client or teammate asks for changes, as a developer, you can
        react to that feedback quickly without tripping up the entire
        process.
        </span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this last lesson, you will plan, organize, and execute development
        iteratively to create a final polished restaurant menu application
    </p>

    <h3> Section 3 - Tackling a Complex Project </h3>

    <p>
        The first step to having an awesome web application is having an
        awesome game plan.  Let's define what our prototype should do after
        completing each iteration.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Let's do some brainstorming to make a 
        <span class="highlight"> checklist of deliverables </span> that
        we want to achieve with each iteration of development, by breaking
        down the project into smaller, easier to manage mini-projects.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
        In the first pass at this project, we'll 
        <span class="highlight"> create mock-ups </span> for every
        page in the restaurant menu app, and design URLs for each page as
        well.  When I finish this iteration, I can show my designs to my
        friends or colleagues for feedback, and that's enough work for our
        first iteration.
        </li>

        <li>
        In the second iteration, you'll 
        <span class="highlight"> set up all of the routings </span> for your
        application in Flask, making sure you can navigate to all of the
        URLs you want to create for your application.  At the end of this
        iteration, you should be able to navigate to all of your URLs, even
        if the pages are not yet created.
        </li>

        <li>
        After that, you will build on top of what you made in the previous
        iteration by 
        <span class="highlight"> 
            creating all of your templates and forms, 
        </span> 
        and making sure that they are properly functioning
        within your application.  Once you have created and filled out
        all of your HTML templates and see them rendering in your
        application, we can move on to the next iteration.
        </li>

        <li>
        Now that you have a good grasp of how your front-end code should
        look, you will 
        <span class="highlight">
            add the back-end functionality, 
        </span>
        making sure all of the actions on the web page are retrieving
        data from your database.  When all of the CRUD operations work
        on all of your web pages, you'll be finished with this
        iteration.
        </li>

        <li>
        You will then 
        <span class="highlight">
            add some endpoints 
        </span>
        that allow the data to be sent if the client requests a menu
        or specific menu item in JSON form.  You will test these API
        calls from within your browser to know you have successfully
        finished this step.
        </li>
        
        <li>
        Finally, you will 
        <span class="highlight">
            add some styling with CSS, JavaScript, and a few static images,
        </span>
        to give your application an appealing layout.  In
        this step, you will also incorporate message flashing into your
        application.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        I chose these steps to create our application because I feel 
        <span class="highlight">
            they naturally build on top of each other, and have a
            clear deliverable at the end of each iteration.
        </span>
        By keeping this in mind, when you plan future projects,
        you'll be better prepared for all kinds of new challenges.
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 4 - Mockups Exercise </h3>

    <p>
        So before we start getting coded, let's take a second to draft up
        our page designs.  There are a ton of good mock-up and wireframing
        applications, that you can download and use to design webpages, but
        for me, pencil and paper is perfect for the first draft.
    </p>

    <p>
        So the first question that comes to mind is, how many types of pages
        this app will have.
    </p>

    <p>
        So when the user lands on the root of my site, they should see a
        list of all the restaurants stored in my database.  From here, they
        can click on a specific restaurant that will show the menu for that
        restaurant.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also want them to be able to add new restaurants, and edit or
        delete existing restaurants from the list.  On a specific menu page,
        the user can view the menu for each restaurant.
    </p>

    <p>
        Similarly, they will have the option to add, edit, and delete menu
        items from a specific menu.  So it looks like we need to create
        eight different webpages for our web app.  I will go ahead and
        specify what I want the URL for each webpage to look like as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Draw markup pages for these eight URLs using pencil and paper or
        your own favorite markup application.  It doesn't have to be
        anything fancy, just a sketch to communicate how you want your
        webpages to look.  Share you markups, get feedback from a friend or
        colleague, and then continue on to the next step of our project.
    </p>

    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 5 - Adding Routes </h3>
  
    <p>
        Now it's time to set up the routing for the application.  In the
        mock-ups, we specify routes for the following pages.  Note that
        landing on the root page of our site will now route us to the page
        that shows all of the restaurants.  And, visiting /restaurant/menu
        ID will automatically take us to the menu page.
    </p>

    <p>
        Create a new Python file called, finalproject.py in the same
        directory as all of our other files.  Import the Flask module and
        the app.run code, like in the previous lesson.  Add the routing for
        all pages into finalproject.py and create the following methods that
        return the appropriate messages in the browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you save and fire up your browser, you should be able to visit
        all of the URLs like so.  At the end of this iteration, you have
        shown that you can get a Flask application up and running,
        accounting for all the necessary pages your app will have.
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 6 - Adding Templates and Forms </h3>
    
    <p>
        In this section, you're going to go ahead and replace those strings
        in your return statements with templates.  In your templates
        directory, make eight new files with the following names.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <code>
        <li> restaurants.html </li>
        <li> newrestaurant.html </li>
        <li> editrestaurant.html </li>
        <li> deleterestaurant.html </li>
        <li> menu.html </li>
        <li> newmenuitem.html </li>
        <li> editmenuitem.html </li>
        <li> deletemenuitem.html </li>
        </code>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Replace the previous return statements such that they now return
        render templates for each of your methods in final project.py.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>
            #Show all restaurants <br>
            @app.route('/') <br>
            @app.route('/restaurant/') <br>
            def showRestaurants(): <br>
            #return "This page will show all my restaurants" <br>
            return render_template('restaurants.html', restaurants=restaurants)
        </code>
    </p>

    <p>
        But wait a second, if we design our templates before connecting to a
        database, Python will throw an error message when we try to refer to
        restaurants and menu items that don't yet exist in our application.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>
        NameError: global name 'restaurants' is not defined
        </code>
    </p>

    <p>
        To get around this problem, we can temporarily make a fake database
        out of dictionaries inside of our final-project.py file.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have made some dictionaries which will serve as dummy variables
        for one restaurant, a collection of restaurants, one menu item, and
        a collection of menu items.  The source code for these dictionaries
        is available in the instructor notes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Go ahead and leave hashtags in the form action and href path, since we
        are focusing more on the structure of our pages in this step, and not
        so much their functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>
        &lt;form action="#" method='post'&gt; <br>
            &lt;a href='#'&gt;
        </code>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, when a user revisits these links in a browser, they should see
        something like this.  The functionality isn't going to be in place
        just yet, but we've just created another prototype that we can use
        to present our progress thus far.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your template should also return a different message to the user if
        there's an empty menu, or empty list of restaurants, maybe something
        like this.  Try and see if you can accommodate for this corner case
        in your templates as well.
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 7 - CRUD Functionality </h3>
    
    <p>
        With our routes and database in place, we can now add the actual
        CRUD Functionality to our page.  Write in the appropriate SQLAlchemy
        statements for the following methods.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> showRestaurants() </li>
        <li> newRestaurant() </li>
        <li> editRestaurant() </li>
        <li> deleteRestaurant() </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li> showMenu() </li>
        <li> newMenuItem() </li>
        <li> editMenuItem() </li>
        <li> deleteMenuItem() </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We also need to add url_for and redirects to our application, when
        necessary.  Some of our routes need to be able to respond to get,
        and post requests.  Be sure to add this functionality, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you are done with this step, you should have a prototype, where
        all the CRUD operations are fully functional.
    </p>

    <p>
        This might be a time consuming iteration to get everything working,
        but I encourage you to stick with it, and not give up.  Use the
        documentation on the Python Flask in SQLAlchemy websites if needed,
        as well.  Also do not hesitate to reach out to your fellow students.
    </p>


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
    <hr>

    <h3> Section 8 - API Endpoints </h3>
    
    <p>
        Now that we have a functioning application, let's add some API
        endpoints to it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The API request should return a JSON object for a list of all
        restaurants, the menu of a specific restaurant, and a specific menu
        item, when a client sends a GET request to one of these three URLs.

        <ul>
            - /restaurants/JSON
            - /restaurants/restaurant_id/menu/JSON
            - /restaurants/restaurant_id/menu/menu_id/JSON
        </ul>

        Remember to import (flask.)jsonify into your project and add a
        'serializable' property to your database set up file where needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your JSON request should return pages like these when you're finished.
    </p>

  


    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

    <h3> Section 09 Stying Your App </h3>
    
    <p>
        In this last section let's put our focus on styling and improving the
        user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Make a static folder and add some CSS files, JavaScript, or images to
        your application to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, add message flashing to your app with the following six
        messages.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li> New Restaurant Created </li>
        <li> Restaurant Successfully Edited </li>
        <li> Restaurant Successfully Deleted </li>
        <li> New Menu Item Created </li>
        <li> Menu Item Successfully Edited </li>
        <li> Menu Item Successfully Deleted </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        In the instructor notes, I've provided a CSS file for reference but I
        strongly encourage you to establish project on your own and give it a
        more personal touch.
    </p>

    <h3> Section 10 Wrap-Up </h3>
    
    <p>
        Congratulations!  You've finished the final project, and reached the
        end of this course.  You've created a data-driven web application,
        and have a beautiful restaurant menu app to show for it.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, we've only scratched the surface of web development, so keep
        going from here.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're interested in learning more about the Flask framework, the
        Flask documentation is a great place to start.
    </p>

    <p>
        Add more features to the restaurant menu application, or create a new
        application of your own, using some of the more advanced features of
        Flask.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will also provide some links in the instruction notes, on deploying
        a Flask application, to be shared with the outside world.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're interested in adding more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features
        to your website, take some time to check out some of Udacity's awesome
        frontend classes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wherever you decide to go next from here, I strongly encourage you to
        immerse yourself in the web development community.
    </p>

    <p>
        Read blogs, experiment, and share your work with other web developers
        and enthusiasts like yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
        [SOUND]. Well, sounds like it's dinner time for me over here.
        Thanks for helping me show what's on the menu.
