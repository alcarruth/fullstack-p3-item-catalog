    <h2> Problem Set 2 </h2>

    <h3> PAWs - The Puppy Adoption Website </h3>

    <p>
        Problem Sets are still under development but this beta version has
        been released for students to view. Please be on the lookout for
        future updates.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the previous Problem Set, you created a puppy shelter database with
        a lot of cool features. In this problem set, you are going to use
        Flask to create a web application for viewing, checking in and
        adopting puppies from these shelters.
    </p>

    <p>
        This problem set is designed to point you to some resources that will
        help you complete the given objectives without explicitly telling you
        how to solve the challenge at hand. Please do not hesitate to reach
        out for help on the forums if anything seems unclear or difficult to
        solve.
    </p>

    <h3> Exercise 1 - Setting up views </h3>

    <p>
        Take a moment to plan out the user experience for your website. Use
        all of the skills you learned in lessons 3 and 4 to iteratively create
        a functioning Flask web application that works with your database of
        puppies. Think of all of the navigation use cases for your
        site. Create page mockups and then design a web application that
        facilitates this process.
    </p>

    <p>
        In your Python code, you should add methods for performing all of the
        database functionalities described below:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> All CRUD operations on Puppies, Shelters, and Owners </li> 
        <li> Switching or Balancing Shelter Population and Protecting against overflows </li> 
        <li> Viewing a Puppy Profile </li> 
        <li> Adopting a New Puppy </li> 
        <li> Creating and Styling Templates (optionally with Bootstrap) </li> 
        <li> Adding Flash Messages </li> 
        <li> BONUS: Pagination </li> 
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3> Exercise 2 - Application Structure for a large Flask Project </h3>

    <p>
        Up until now, most of our Python code for creating Flask projects has
        lived in two files. We’ve been calling them database_setup.py and
        project.py. Using a minimal number of python files is great for
        learning how Flask works but as an application grows and becomes more
        complex, reorganizing this code into different files makes navigating
        code easier and identifying concerns in a more modular fashion more
        doable. For this exercise you will rearrange your code into a package
        making your code more manageable.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Where do I start? </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Read through Flask documentation on packages: <br>
        <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/packages/">
            http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/packages/ </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Explore Flask also has some good literature on packages: <br>
        <a href="https://exploreflask.com/organizing.html#organization-patterns">
            https://exploreflask.com/organizing.html#organization-patterns </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Create a package for your application complete with an init.py file,
        views.py, models.py, and any other smaller modules you see fit to
        better organize your application. Discuss your package organization
        with other students.
    </p>

    <h3> Exercise 3 - Using Flask Extensions </h3>

    <p>
        Flask is designed to be a very lightweight and minimalist framework
        upon installation, giving the programmer much more control over design
        decisions when creating a web application. Flask extensions are
        packages created by other developers to allow additional
        functionalities to be added quickly and easily.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this activity you should learn about flask extensions and
        specifically read about WTForms. What features does WTForms provide
        compared to collecting form data manually? Add the WTForms package to
        your application and implement its code when you collect form data and
        add some validation rules that prevent poorly formatted information
        from being saved to the database (blank first or last name, email
        address without “@” or “.”)
    </p>

    </p>


    <h3> Exerise 4 - Logging </h3>

    <p>
        Logging is a great way of tracking app use and behavior for when the
        unexpected occurs. Logging also helps create a paper trail in case any
        abnormal activity or behavior happens on your app.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this exercise, you will go to the Flask documentation again and
        figure out how to log information to a text file any time a puppy is
        added or adopted.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Where do I start? </b>
    </p>

            http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/#logging </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Feeling Extra Udacious?
    </p>

    <p>
        Good logging ensures good communication between the developers and
        those responsible for maintaining an app once it’s up and running. (IT
        or DevOps). Delve deeper into good logging practices and consider
        implementing some of the following features into your application.
    </p>

    <p>
        log rotation: If you server process keeps appending to the same log
        file forever, eventually it will fill up the disk ... it should
        probably close the file and start a new one periodically
    </p>

    <p>
        remote logging / log saving : how do you get my logs off of the
        individual container and into permanent storage?
    </p>


    <h3> Exercise 5 - Email/SMS Support </h3>

    <p>
        Being able to provide feedback via email is a part of almost every web
        application experience nowadays. Integrating email support in Flask
        has been simplified with the Flask-Mail extension. For this exercise
        send an email or SMS to the owner each time a puppy is adopted.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Where do I start? </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Check out this page about the Flask-Mail extension: <br>
        <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/flask-mail/">
            https://pythonhosted.org/flask-mail/ </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Twilio has an SMS python package that can be easily used with Flask,
        check out 
        <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2012/01/making-an-sms-birthday-card-with-python-and-flask.html">
            this tutorial. </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Spam Alert!
    </p>

    <p>
        If your application lets people enter unconfirmed email addresses,
        your app may be vulnerable to being compromised by a spambot. Account
        confirmation via email is a good way to circumvent this problem. In
        later exercises you will have challenges to confirm user accounts via
        email.
    </p>


    <h3> Exercise 6 - User Authentication </h3>

    <p>
        If you’ve already taken the course on Authentication and
        Authorization, you know that implementing secure user authentication
        on a web application can be a very difficult task to complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using OAuth providers can simplify the user authentication process for
        you and your users. But in some cases it may be necessary to implement
        user authentication on your own.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this challenge, you will add user authentication using either an
        OAuth provider, implementing your own user logins or if you’re feeling
        extra ambitious, a hybridized approach that allows both login
        options. You can consider the potential owners as the users of the
        application.
    </p>

    <p>
        This challenge will be tough. You may want to wait until you’ve
        completed Authentication and Authorization before attempting this
        challenge. As always, please reach out for help if you get stuck and
        be sure to give yourself a pat on the back once you’ve completed this
        exercise.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you do chose to implement your own user authentication please be
        sure all of the following features are implemented in your
        application:

    <h3> Exercise 7 - Testing and Performance </h3>

    <p>
        Up to this point, you’ve created a pretty complex application. So how
        can you be sure everything is working correctly? Testing your
        application is a way to find bugs before your users do. In addition,
        even if there are no coding bugs, maybe some performance issues might
        create a less than pleasant user experience for visitors to your
        page. In this exercise you will read about Coverage, The Flask Test
        Client, and Selenium in order to create a test suite for your
        application. You should also find a way to identify and log slow
        queries to address performance issues that arise with a growing
        database. Share your testing strategy with other students and view the
        strategies they implemented as well.

    <h3> Exercise 8 - Deployment </h3>
        
    <p>
        Ready to take your application live? It’s time to deploy your
        application and share it with other Udacians and the whole
        world. Deploying can be a challenge the first time around but keep at
        it and use all of your resources to get your app properly functioning
        on the web.

    <h3> Going Further </h3>

    <p>
        Here are a few more features you could add to your website, the
        possibilities are endless so feel free to challenge yourself and and
        more improvements to your puppy adoption website!
    </p>

    <p>
        Full Text Search Feature
    </p>

    <p>
        Adding full text search can be a complicated task. If you are up for
        the challenge take a look at this blog post by Miguel Grinberg and see
        if you can add search functionality to your web application:
    </p>

    <p>

            The flask mega tutoria -part x full text search </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Add a searchable feature to your database, search for a dog by name
        and return the results of that search with relevant information in the
        search results. Make a query in SQLAlchemy that returns all of the
        shelters that have a dog named 'Rudy', sort results by shelter name,
        and by puppy age.
    </p>

    <p>
        AJAX
    </p>

    <p>
        AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a popular way of delivering
        data to a webpage without prompting a page refresh. When used
        appropriately, integrating AJAX into a web application can have a
        great impact on the user experience. For this exercise, you will
        return search results using AJAX instead of rendering a new web page.
