    <h1> Fullstack P3 Item Catalog </h1>

    <h3> Project Description </h3>

    <p>
        In this project, you will be developing a web application that
        provides a list of items within a variety of categories and
        integrate third party user registration and
        authentication. Authenticated users should have the ability to
        post, edit, and delete their own items.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be creating this project essentially from scratch, no
        templates have been provided for you. This means that you have
        free reign over the HTML, the CSS, and the files that include
        the application itself utilizing Flask.
    </p>

    <h3> Project Display Example </h3>

    <p>
        Note: The screenshots on this page are just examples of one
        implementation of the minimal functionality. You are
        encouraged to redesign and strive for even better solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this sample project, the homepage displays all current
        categories with the latest added items.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code> <b> http://localhost:8000/ </b> </code>
    </p>

    <img src="images/home_page.png" alt="home page">

    <p> Selecting a specific category shows you all the items
        available for that category.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code> <b> http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/items </b> </code>
    </p>

    <img src="images/category_page.png" alt="category page">

    <p>
        Selecting a specific item shows you specific information about
        that item.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code> <b> http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/Snowboard </b> </code>
    </p>

    <img src="images/item_page.png" alt="item page">

    <p>
        After logging in, a user has the ability to add, update, or
        delete item information. Users should be able to modify only
        those items that they themselves have created.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code> <b> http://localhost:8000/ </b> </code> (logged in)
    </p>

    <img src="images/add_item1.png" alt="add_item1">

    <p>
        <code> <b> http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboarding/Snowboard </b> </code> (logged in)
    </p>

    <img src="images/add_item2.png" alt="add_item2">

    <p>
        <code> <b> http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboard/edit </b> </code> (logged in)
    </p>

    <img src="images/edit_item.png" alt="edit item">

    <p>
        <code> <b> http://localhost:8000/catalog/Snowboard/delete </b> </code> (logged in)
    </p>

    <img src="images/delete_item.png" alt="delete_item">

    <p>
        The application should provide a JSON endpoint at the very least.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code> <b> http://localhost:8000/catalog.json </b> </code>
    </p>

    <h3> Getting Started </h3>

    <p>
        Before we begin coding, there are several steps that
        you should take to make sure that you have everything
        downloaded in order to run your future web
        application.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Install ​Vagrant​ and ​VirtualBox​ if you have not done so
            already. Instructions on how to do so can be found on the
            websites as well as​ in the course materials.​
        </li>
        <li>
            Clone the fullstack­nanodegree­vm repository​. There is a
            catalog folder provided for you, but no files have been
            included. If a catalog folder does not exist, simply
            create your own inside of the vagrant folder.
        </li>
        <li>
            Launch the Vagrant VM (by typing ​vagrant up ​in the
            directory ​ fullstack/vagrant ​from the terminal). You can
            find further instructions on how to do so ​here​.
        </li>
        <li>
            Write the Flask application locally in the
            /vagrant/catalog ​ directory (which will automatically be
            synced to /vagrant/catalog ​ within the VM). Name it
            application.py.
        </li>
        <li>
            Run your application within the VM by typing ​python
            /vagrant/catalog/application.py into the Terminal. If you
            named the file from step 4 as something other than ​
            application.py ​ , in the above command substitute in the
            file name on your computer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Access and test your application by visiting ​
            http://localhost:8000​ locally on your browser.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        There are four parts that you will need to complete: 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> the HTML </li>
        <li> the CSS </li>
        <li> the Flask Application </li>
        <li> it must include authentication/authorization </li>
        <li> the database </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Additional Functionality </h3>

    <p>
        In addition to the basic functions listed above, this project
        has many opportunities to go above and beyond what is
        required. Some ways to achieve exceeds specifications are to
        include the following requirements:
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> API Endpoints​: </b> Research and implement additional API
        endpoints, such as RSS, Atom, or XML. While we do require at
        the bare minimum a JSON endpoint, we encourage you to research
        and implement a different endpoint to see what else is out
        there.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> CRUD: Read​: </b> Add an item image field that is read from
        the database and displayed on the page. This project is being
        built from scratch meaning that the information that you
        include and the layout of the page are entirely up to you. Add
        pictures for a more vibrant web application!
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> CRUD: Create​: </b> Update the new item form to correctly
        process the inclusion of item images. If you included
        additional information to include images, there should be a
        way to include those images when entering in new items into
        the database.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> CRUD: Update:​ </b> Update the edit/update item form to
        correctly process the inclusion of item images. Again, to stay
        consistent with the inclusion of images, items that already
        exist should have the option of changing the image as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> CRUD: Delete:​ </b> Research and implement this function
        using POST requests and nonces to prevent cross­site request
        forgeries (CSRF).
    </p>

    <p>
        <b> Comments​: </b> Comments are not just a way for you to keep
        track of what you’re writing in terms of code, but also a
        great way to help other developers who may be reading your
        code. While comment preferences may differ from team to team,
        the general idea is that good comments cover the main purpose
        of the code, mention inputs and outputs, etc. Check out the
        comments section of ​ PEP­8​ and the Google Python Style Guide​
        to get a better idea of good comments.
    </p>

    <p>
        These are some points present on the rubric on how to exceed
        specifications, but there are many other ways to create a
        project that goes above and beyond to capture the attentions
        of future employers.  Because this project is created from
        scratch, feel free to display the website you believe is
        best. Have fun with the design and the layout.  Go through
        documentation to see if there are any other features that will
        cause your website to be more dynamic and efficient. The sky
        is truly the limit on this project.
    </p> 


    <h3> To Submit </h3>

    <p>
        Once you have finished your project, go to this link here. If
        you have a Github account (which we recommend), connect with
        Github to get started. If you do not have a Github account,
        follow the instructions here for Mac OS X 10.0 or later, here
        for Windows 7, 8, or 8.1, or here for anything else. These
        links will help you create a Github account to submit your
        project.
    </p>
